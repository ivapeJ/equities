        <p>
            At TYH Equities, our story is one of passion, purpose, and a deep commitment to making a difference in behavioral health. Our journey began with a strong foundation in operational excellence, rooted in a love for process improvement and creating systems that work better and smoother.
        </p>
        <p>
            Witnessing firsthand the challenges faced by individuals, families, and staff in this growing field, we knew we had found our calling. Behavioral health is more than a service—it’s a growing necessity, touching lives in ways that few other fields can.
        </p>
        <p>
            We recognized that behind every behavioral health facility is a need for operational excellence, compassionate care, and innovative strategies to meet increasing demands. TYH Equities was born out of this realization, combining a clear vision with years of operational expertise to create sustainable, impactful facilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our mission is simple: to transform behavioral health properties into thriving, efficient centers of healing. We do this by acquiring facilities with untapped potential, enhancing their operations, and ensuring they meet the highest standards of care. Backed by seasoned investors with proven experience in healthcare, we bring a strong network and operational insight to every project.
        </p>
        <p>
            At TYH Equities, we don’t just invest in properties—we invest in people, processes, and the promise of a better tomorrow.
